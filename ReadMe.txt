Hi, thanks for downloading my pack!

To install this, as long as you have the Bedrock RTX beta, all that should be necessary is double clicking
the "RTX Vanilla Conversion.mcpack" file. This should load it into your game, and during world creation, or
in the settings of an existing world, you should be able to activate it from the "my packs" section. If you
have any issues with this, feel free to message me on reddit u/TheCivilHulk, or on the discord for r/MinecraftRTX.

If you wish to use the Clear Glass Patch/Colored Lighting Patch follow the same steps, but be sure to have it activated above the conversion pack in the settings, otherwise the regular glass/terracotta textures will override the clear ones!

Happy Crafting!
