Hi, thanks for downloading my pack!

To install this, as long as you have the Bedrock RTX beta, all that should be necessary is double clicking
the "RTX Vanilla Conversion.mcpack" file. This should load it into your game, and during world creation, or
in the settings of an existing world, you should be able to activate it from the "my packs" section. If you
have any issues with this, feel free to message me on reddit u/TheCivilHulk, or on the discord for r/MinecraftRTX.

If you wish to use the Clear Glass Patch/Colored Lighting Patch follow the same steps, but be sure to have it 
activated above the conversion pack in the settings, otherwise the regular glass/terracotta textures 
will override the clear ones!

The two colored lighting patches work as follows. The Terracotta version replaces all versions of terracotta blocks except for the normal, light gray, gray, and black versions with pure colored emissive variants. The Concrete version replaces all versions of the concrete powder blocks except for the light gray, gray, and black versions, with pure colored emissive variants. The two packs can be used separately or in tandem as needed.

Deku from the RTX Discord has been working on some of their own stuff using my pack as a starting point and using TextureEdit! They've made a lot of cool stuff and are still working actively, so be sure to check it out in the Deku Addons Folder!

Happy Crafting!
